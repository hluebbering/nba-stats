## 1. **Refine & Expand Feature Engineering**

1. **Minutes Projection / Separate “Minutes” Model**  
   - Predicting game-to-game minutes often yields significant gains in points prediction.  
   - Consider building a standalone model (or a rolling average approach) to project minutes, then feed those predicted minutes into your main points model as `MIN_PROJ`.

2. **Contextual Game Features**  
   - **Vegas Lines**: Use point spread or over/under as a proxy for game tempo and blowout potential.  

3. **Teammate/Lineup Synergy**  
   - If a key teammate is injured or out, the player’s usage can spike.  
   - More advanced: synergy-based features (lineup on/off stats), though that requires more granular data.

4. [] **Streaks & Hot Hands**  
   - Rolling or exponential weighted averages of recent points can capture whether a player is “hot.”  
   - Also track usage streaks—some players see an uptick in usage after a few strong games.

## 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning & Ensemble Methods**

1. **Grid/Random Search**  
   - Incorporate **time-series cross-validation** in the search (rather than random splits).

2. **Ensemble Approaches**  
   - **Stacking**: Combine outputs from multiple models (e.g., BayesianRidge + CatBoost + GradientBoosting).
   - **Bagging/Blending**: A simple weighted average of 2-3 strong models often stabilizes predictions.

3. **Bayesian Optimization**  
   - Optuna, Hyperopt, or scikit-optimize tools tune hyperparameters more efficiently than grid/random searches.

## 3. **Advanced Time-Series Approaches**

1. **Rolling/Expanding Windows**  
   - Instead of a single time-split (e.g., “first 80% for train, last 20% for test”), do multiple rolling windows.

## 4. **Injury/Rotations & Real-Time Updates**

1. [] **Injury Reports**  
   - [] If your use case is daily fantasy or real-time sports betting, incorporate official injury updates and questionable/probable tags.  
   - [] Mark star players out for the game, recalculate usage/role-based features or adjust the minutes model.

2. **Rotation Patterns**  
   - Some coaches have predictable rotations. If you can glean that data, you can refine your minute or usage projections even more precisely.

## 5. **Explainability & Debugging**

1. [] **SHAP**
   - [] Use SHAP to see which features are most influential globally across all predictions.
   - Identify if certain features (e.g., `PACE_PER40_AVG_LAST_5`, `VOL_MIN_LAST_5`) consistently drive up or down predictions.
   - Prune features that are not globally influential.

2. **Partial Dependence & ICE Plots**  
   - Understand how changing, say, `USG_PCT_AVG_LAST_5` or `MIN_PROJ` influences predicted points.  

3. **Residual Breakdown**  
   - Continue performing residual analysis by team, position, minutes played, or usage.  
   - Investigate outliers to see if unexpected injuries, ejections, or overtime games skewed model.

## 6. **Operational Deployment**

1. **Automated Data Pipeline**  
   - Schedule daily or weekly data pulls from the NBA API for game logs, advanced box scores, and updated rosters.  
   - Insert into a local or cloud database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.) to have a unified data store.

2. **Model Retraining/Updating**  
   - Decide how often to retrain. Weekly or daily.

3. **API or Script**  
   - If you want real-time predictions, host a simple API endpoint that, given a player’s ID, returns the predicted points for the next game.  
   - Alternatively, a daily script can produce a CSV or database table of predictions for all players.

## 7. **Beyond Traditional Models**

1. **Neural Networks / Deep Learning**  
   - An MLP (multilayer perceptron) or a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM, GRU) might capture temporal patterns if you feed the last N game stats as sequences.  
   - Transformers are increasingly used for time series, though they can be more complex to set up.

2. **Reinforcement Learning or Simulation**  
   - In extreme cases (e.g., simulating entire playoff outcomes), you might embed your points predictions in a larger simulation environment. This is advanced, but it can yield interesting insights.

Key/ID Mappings

If your main data references TEAM_ID and PLAYER_ID, you might store a small dictionary that maps TEAM_NAME (e.g., "Atlanta Hawks") to TEAM_ID (1610612737) and PLAYER_NAME to PLAYER_ID.
This ensures merges are consistent.
Star Out Feature

For your minutes model, consider a feature indicating if a star (one of the team’s typical starters or top usage players) is out.
The model can learn that bench players might see +5 minutes when a star is missing.
Automation

If you want daily predictions, set up a cron job (or scheduled task in Windows, or a GitHub Action) to:
Scrape ESPN injuries in the morning.
Run your pipeline with that day’s data.
Generate a CSV or database table of predicted outcomes.
Injury Status Changes

Real NBA injuries can fluctuate day-of. A “questionable” player might be announced “out” an hour before tip-off. If you need up-to-the-minute accuracy (DFS, betting), you might re-run your pipeline in the afternoon or 1 hour before games.

Historical Model Training

If you want your model to learn from past seasons (e.g., “When a star was out, certain players’ minutes spiked”), then you need historical daily injury data going back as far as you have game logs.
This can be more time-consuming since you’d have to store or reconstruct the day-by-day status for each player.
